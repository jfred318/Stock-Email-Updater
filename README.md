To use this program, you must complete a couple of steps. First, you need a password, not the password you normally sign into your email with, but an app password. List the password under "user_password" and use your email for the receiver and sender addresses. Then, I created an EC2 instance through Amazon web services and used the terminal to connect it to my Python script. The instance runs twice a day and pulls the stock information from Yahoo Finance.
